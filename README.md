- 👋 Hi, I’m @DavidRR93
- 👀 I’m interested in learning code programming in several languages like Python and other math programs like MatLab. But I'm actually here to place a code I developed for my Career's Final Project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MatLab for my Career's Final Project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever helps to learn programming languages.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Well, I doubt anyone actually wants to reach me.
